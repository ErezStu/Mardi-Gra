      <h4>Our Mayor - LaToya Cantrell</h4>
      <p>
        LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, a
        post she has held since May 7, 2018.
        Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first woman to hold the post.
        Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles.
        She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University
        of Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood.
        In 2003, she joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association
        in 2004.
        After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood
        flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward.
        In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back
        Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for
        Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace.
        In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to
        organize opposition to the panel's recommendation.
        She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the
        neighborhood.

      <h4>About Mardi Gras</h4>

      <p>
        ardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or
        after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday,
        which is known as Shrove Tuesday.
        Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last
        night of eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.
        Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious
        obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent.
        In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the
        word shrive, meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to.
        The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana,
        consider Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins
        Epiphany) to Ash Wednesday.
        Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.
        In Mobile,
        Alabama, Mardi Gras–associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on
        Thanksgiving, then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to
        midnight before Ash Wednesday.

      <h4>What's New</h4>

      <p>
        According to Carnival historian Errol Laborde, the first reports of items being thrown as part of an official
        Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans came in the early 1870s with the Twelfth Night Revelers.
        Following their parade, which
        featured a “Mother Goose’s Tea Party” theme, a man in a Santa suit tossed gifts to the crowds from his bag.

      <h4>History</h4>

      <p>
        Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of spring and fertility such
        as
        Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC.
        This celebration honored the god of agriculture, Saturn. It was
        observed in
        mid-December, before the sowing of winter crops.
        It was a week-long festival when work and business came to a
        halt.
        Schools and courts of law closed, and the normal social patterns were suspended.
        On the Julian calendar, which
        the Romans adopted in 45 BC, the winter solstice fell on December 25.
        Hence, the celebration gradually became
        associated with Christmas.

They held a small celebration and dubbed their landing spot Point du Mardi Gras.", "You'll hear laissez les bon temps rouler (pronounced lay-say le bon tom roo-lay) over and over again at Mardi Gras celebrations. It means 'let the good times roll' in Cajun French. We can get behind that idea!", "In New Orleans, carnival season begins on Epiphany, also known as Three Kings Day. Many smaller parades are hosted leading up to the 12-day parading period. But the last five days make up the main weekend (from Thursday night until the morning of Fat Tuesday), when the largest parades run back-to-back.", "While some krewes have been hosting Mardi Gras parades for years, others have formed more recently. Most are named after Roman or Greek mythology.", "It’s not just a tradition—it’s the law! Everyone on the float must wear a mask or paint their face. The practice was originally started to encourage people to mingle and talk to those outside of your social circle.", "Each float in a Mardi Gras parade is decorated differently to fit into a central theme, which can be anything from literature to humor. And they don't waste any time getting to work: Most start on the following year's floats as soon as Fat Tuesday is over.", "Historians believe Mardi Gras arrived in North America in 1699 and then spread to New Orleans in 1718. The Mistick Krewe of Comus was the first to roll floats about 60 miles from New Orleans in 1856. Krewe of Rex was the first of the type of parade krewes we see today.", "According to How Stuff Works, each parade kicks off with the krewe leader. Next comes the king or queen, followed by the maids and dukes, before the rest of the members.", "You may assume that Mardi Gras is one wild party, but there are some spots you can go that are family friendly, too. Try finding an area along the parade route uptown if you're looking for a more PG experience.", "Just use the magic words: 'Throw me something, mister!' as floats pass by, and watch as krewe members happily toss you beads and toys.", "In addition to paying a membership fee, krewe members dish out major cash for beads, costumes, security, clean-up crews, and Mardi Gras balls year after year. Luckily, many krewes allow members to take a break for a year, as long as they send a friend to ride (and pay) in their place."];
