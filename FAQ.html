          <h2>Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</h2>

          <p>
            Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question
            below) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins.
            It is also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat
            Tuesday
            "Mardi Gras Day."
            Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to
            Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."

          <h2>What is Twelfth Night?</h2>

          <p>
            Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the official
            start of Mardi Gras every year.
            While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night does not.

          <h2>When was the first Mardi Gras?</h2>

          <p>
            The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb.
            24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began the
            tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.

          <h2>What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come from?</h2>

          <p>
            Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892.
            Purple
            stands for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.

          <i></i>

          <h2>Why are masks worn?</h2>

          <p>
            By law, float riders must always have a mask on.
            On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.
          </p>

          <h2>Do I need tickets?</h2>

          <p>
            There is no need for tickets to see a parade... all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The
            Greatest Free Show on Earth!".
            You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.

They held a small celebration and dubbed their landing spot Point du Mardi Gras.", "You'll hear laissez les bon temps rouler (pronounced lay-say le bon tom roo-lay) over and over again at Mardi Gras celebrations. It means 'let the good times roll' in Cajun French. We can get behind that idea!", "In New Orleans, carnival season begins on Epiphany, also known as Three Kings Day. Many smaller parades are hosted leading up to the 12-day parading period. But the last five days make up the main weekend (from Thursday night until the morning of Fat Tuesday), when the largest parades run back-to-back.", "While some krewes have been hosting Mardi Gras parades for years, others have formed more recently. Most are named after Roman or Greek mythology.", "It’s not just a tradition—it’s the law! Everyone on the float must wear a mask or paint their face. The practice was originally started to encourage people to mingle and talk to those outside of your social circle.", "Each float in a Mardi Gras parade is decorated differently to fit into a central theme, which can be anything from literature to humor. And they don't waste any time getting to work: Most start on the following year's floats as soon as Fat Tuesday is over.", "Historians believe Mardi Gras arrived in North America in 1699 and then spread to New Orleans in 1718. The Mistick Krewe of Comus was the first to roll floats about 60 miles from New Orleans in 1856. Krewe of Rex was the first of the type of parade krewes we see today.", "According to How Stuff Works, each parade kicks off with the krewe leader. Next comes the king or queen, followed by the maids and dukes, before the rest of the members.", "You may assume that Mardi Gras is one wild party, but there are some spots you can go that are family friendly, too. Try finding an area along the parade route uptown if you're looking for a more PG experience.", "Just use the magic words: 'Throw me something, mister!' as floats pass by, and watch as krewe members happily toss you beads and toys.", "In addition to paying a membership fee, krewe members dish out major cash for beads, costumes, security, clean-up crews, and Mardi Gras balls year after year. Luckily, many krewes allow members to take a break for a year, as long as they send a friend to ride (and pay) in their place."];
